Mappy - An Airport Mapping Prototype

Mappy is an airport mapping app prototype that allows users to add stops to fulfill their needs while getting to their next layover. It uses d3.js for data visualization using Dijkstra's algorithm to form optimal paths. Express is used to route the app, and handlebars are used to dynamically render static pages.
